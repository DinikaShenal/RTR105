## Report on Lab Work 1

This report discusses the functionality of the Taylor series format of the Arcsine(x) function. Therefore, this lab work addresses the level of similarity and accuracy of the coded Taylor series function against the Existing "asin(x)" command in the "math.h" library in C. Nonetheless, according to the results obtained in this lab work, it became evident that the Coded Taylor series function of the "Arcsin(x)" is very accurate to the answer provided by the "asin(x)" function present in the "math.h" library.
