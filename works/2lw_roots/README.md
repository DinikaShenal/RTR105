# Report on Lab Work 2

## Introduction

This report discusses the existence of roots in the Function "Arcsine(x)". 
Therefore, a code has been implemented in the "bisection.c" file according to the Mathematical Bisections method.
Furthermore, the coded "arcsin_solv" function which was present in the "arcsin.c" file in the "1lw_series" folder has been copied and pasted in this 
"bisections.c" file in order to get the corresponding Arcsine(x) values for the user entered limits of x vlaues.
Furthermore, this lab work focuses on functions with "Odd" number of roots and it would not give a result to "Even" number of roots containing function and 
this was coded according to the instructions of the lecturer.
