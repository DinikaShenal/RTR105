# Report on Lab Work 5

## Introduction

This report discusses the several statistical features that are employed on the various characters present in a user inputted sentence. In this Lab Work, the code is designed to employ the backgroud ASCII code of each character in order to perform all the required statistical functions according to the Lab Work on the user inputted sentence. Further to that, in this Lab Work, a histogram has been plotted using the Gnuplot feature in order to present the statistical number of occurences of each character present in the user inputted sentence.

## Operation of the Lab Work

Firstly, the "statistics.c" is the file that contains the main function of this Lab Work which ultimately performs various statistical functions on the characters present within a user entered sentence. This "statistics.c" file is designed to perform the following statistical features :

   1) The Minimum Character present within the Sentence. 
   2) The Maximum Character present within the Sentence.
